# Helth Check

Health Check is a simple tool that runs a series of tests to check the health
of your system. It returns a system health score and a list of failed tests.
It is designed to run with a daemon that can be used in a lot of different
ways. For example, it can be used in the prompt of your shell to show the
health of your system. It can also be used (with a wrapper) to send
notifications to your email when your system is not healthy (useful for
servers).

## Installation

For now, you can only use the daemon from the source code.

## Usage

### Daemon

The daemon is a D-Bus service that runs the tests and provides a D-Bus
interface to get the health score and the list of failed tests (coming soon).

To run the daemon, you need to have D-Bus installed and running. Then, you can
run the daemon with:

```shell
python3 -m health_check.daemon # Not supported yet, will work when installed
```

You can also run the daemon without installing it:

```shell
python3 .
```

### Client

Since the daemon is a D-Bus service, you can use any D-Bus client to get the
health score and the list of failed tests.

### Shell

In shell, you can use the `dbus-send` command to access the daemon. For
example, to get the health score, you can run:

```shell
dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=org.healthcheck /org/healthcheck org.healthcheck.Score.get_score`
```

To get only the health score, you can run:

```shell
echo $(dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=org.healthcheck /org/healthcheck org.healthcheck.Score.get_score 2>/dev/null || echo '-1') | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $NF}'
```

To integrate this in your PowerLevel10k prompt, you can add the following
segment to your `~/.p10k.zsh`:

```zsh
# Health Check
function prompt_healthcheck() {
    local health_score="$(echo $(dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=org.healthcheck /org/healthcheck org.healthcheck.Score.get_score 2>/dev/null || echo '-1') | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $NF}')"
    # If health score is -1, then healthcheck is not running, so don't show anything
    if (( health_score == -1 )); then
        return
    fi
    # The health score is a number between 0 and 100 (100 being the best), so
    # we can use it to determine the color of the segment
    # In normal use, the score is between 60 and 80, so we'll use that as the
    # threshold for the colors
    if (( health_score >= 80 )); then
        p10k segment -s HEALTHY -f green -i 'üè•' -t "${health_score}"
    elif (( health_score >= 60 )); then
        p10k segment -s OK -f 248 -i 'üè•' -t "${health_score}"
    elif (( health_score >= 40 )); then
        p10k segment -s WARNING -f yellow -i 'üè•' -t "${health_score}"
    elif (( health_score >= 20 )); then
        p10k segment -s DANGER -f red -i 'üè•' -t "${health_score}"
    else
        p10k segment -s CRITICAL -f red -i 'üè•' -t "${health_score}"
    fi
}
```

and then add `prompt_healthcheck` to your `POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS`
or `POWERLEVEL9K_RIGHT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS`.

### Python

You can also access the daemon from Python. The `client.py` file contains an
example of how to do it. Of course, you can also use your own D-Bus client.

## Tests

The tests are located in the `health_check/tests` directory. They are
designed to be as simple as possible. They are also designed to be as
independent as possible. For example, the `battery` test does not depend on
the `cpu` test. This way, you can run the tests on any system, even if some
tests are not supported.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You can contribute by adding new tests or by
improving the existing ones. You can also contribute by improving the daemon
or the client.
