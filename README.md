# Helth Check

Health Check is a simple tool that runs a series of tests to check the health
of your system. It returns a system health score and a list of failed tests.
It is designed to run with a daemon that can be used in a lot of different
ways. For example, it can be used in the prompt of your shell to show the
health of your system. It can also be used (with a wrapper) to send
notifications to your email when your system is not healthy (useful for
servers).
